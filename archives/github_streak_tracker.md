FreeCodeCamp has a nice streak tracker on their profile page https://www.freecodecamp.org/drazisil

It appears to only track work on their site though

I'd like one that works on my GitHub profile and helps me track my #100DaysOfCode work https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4

Maybe a Greasemonkey scrpt?

https://github.com/Naramsim/GithubOriginalStreak is perfect!
