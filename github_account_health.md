I'd love a dashboard or health report to tracks subscribed issues, stale branches, stared repo activity feeds, etc.

Dashboard-zero (which was a Mozilla project I took over and dropped, it's not located in _archive) was a start to this idea. It didn't quite reach the vision I have, and dies due to lack of frontend knowledge and help.

GitHub still doesn't have a way to list subscribed issues, which is insane. In addition, it would be great to have the ability to track interesting projects, without staring them. Even if I star a project, I get no notification of activity. Watching a busy project will just generate way too my distriptive noice, and I'll quickly start ignoring it.
