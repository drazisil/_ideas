Looking for a #NodeJS logger that will know what line it ran on. 

Bonus points if it can detect if it's in a function and prefix the line.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/logtrace looks perfect, but hasn't been touched in a while and no longer exists on GitHub. 
I've contacted the author to see if they would be ok with me taking it over.
